The code provided above is a simulation of how you would integrate Pydantic, OpenAI, and LlamaIndex into your controllers/aiController.js file in a real-world scenario. It includes:

1. A Pydantic model ExtractedData to represent the structure of the data extracted from the resume.
2. A function extract_data_from_resume that simulates the extraction of professional history and bio using LlamaIndex.
3. A function generate_interview_questions that simulates generating interview questions using the OpenAI API.
4. A placeholder for where you would integrate these functions into your /upload-resume endpoint, including saving the extracted data and generated questions to the database and returning them to the front-end.

To implement this in your actual application, you would need to replace the placeholder OpenAI API key with your actual key, implement the real data extraction logic with LlamaIndex, and handle the database operations.
